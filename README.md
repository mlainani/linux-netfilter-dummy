# linux-netfilter-dummy

This code aims at providing a simple example of a Netfilter hook for
IPv6 packets. Refer to Figure 18-1 of "Understanding Linux Network
Internals" by Christian Benvenuti for a good picture of where in the
packet flow the various hooks are invoked (preview for this page is
available at Google Books as of this writing). Another good books on
this topic is "Designing and Implementing Linux Firewalls and QoS
using netfilter, iproute2, NAT, and L7-filter" by Lucian Gheorghe.
